# Bank Modern App

### A modern banking app built with React

## 1. Project Description

A static website for a fictional bank, built with React. The website is a single page application (SPA) that uses React Router to navigate between different sections of the page. The website is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## 2. Project Structure

This code is a React component written in JavaScript. It's the main application file, typically named App.jsx.

At the top, it imports the React library, a styles object from a local style file, and several components from a local components directory. These components are likely to be reusable pieces of the user interface, such as a navigation bar (Navbar), a hero section (Hero), a statistics section (Stats), and so on.

The App function is a stateless functional component that returns JSX (JavaScript XML), which allows us to write HTML-like syntax in our JavaScript code. The App component returns a div with several classes, including bg-primary, w-full, and overflow-hidden. These classes likely provide styling for the div.

Inside this div, there are three more div elements, each containing another div with the class boxWidth. The first two div elements contain the Navbar and Hero components respectively. The third div contains several other components (Stats, Business, Billing, CardDeal, Testimonials, Clients, CTA, Footer), which are arranged in a specific order to form the structure of the web page.

The styles object is used to apply additional classes to the div elements. These classes are likely defined in the style file and provide additional styling to the elements.

Finally, the App component is exported so that it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.
